# RUscripts

This readme file is now deprecated.

You can now use our new read until code available at : https://github.com/looselab/ru

Documentation is available at: http://mattloose.github.io/RUscriptsdocs/

The scripts here are referenced by the paper available at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/03/038760

To get started either download this repository using the ZIP options or (preferably)

    git clone https://github.com/mattloose/RUscripts



Important Note:

Running read until will influence the behaviour of your flow cell and change the output of your sequencing experiment. You are strongly advised to run simulations of read until prior to running on a live flow cell. The code as presented here is a demonstration of read until and one method by which it can be implemented. Users run this code entirely at their own risk.

#Getting help with read until.

We are happy to help where we can. Please feel free to contact via twitter ({at}mattloose) or email matt.loose{@}nottingham.ac.uk . We will try to update this read me file whenever significant changes are made to the API or minKNOW versions that might affect read until. For issues with the API itself or the ws_event_sampler program, users will most likely be redirected to ONT.
