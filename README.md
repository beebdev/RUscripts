# RUscripts

This is a forked repository from https://github.com/looselab/RUscripts that aims to do hardware acceleration (FPGA) on DTW used in the squiggle matching process. Currently the offline RUscript "test_gReadUntil.py" works with python 3.8.5.

You can now use our new read until code available at : https://github.com/looselab/ru

Documentation is available at: http://mattloose.github.io/RUscriptsdocs/

The scripts here are referenced by the paper available at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/03/038760
